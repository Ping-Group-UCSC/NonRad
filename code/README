Introduction
==================

`calc_auto.py` computes nonradiative lifetime from two series of DFT calculations (inital and final states).


`calc_hr*.py` compute HR factor from full phonon or 1D effective coordinate method.
    Support both phononpy or ph.x. See 2018-10-BNnonrad/CN/6x6-pbe-k1/calchr* (Phonopy) and 2018-10-BNnonrad/NBNV/6x6-oop/pbe/calchr (ph.x)  for examples

Required QE calculations
=============================

Two options point to two folders are necessary:
folder_final_state: folder contains SCF calculations of the final state at different geometries. Must contains ratio-* style folder with scf.out inside.
folder_init_state: folder contains SCF calculations of the final state at different geometries. 

each ratio_* folders should contain a SCF calculation at specific Q. The ratio_* structures can be generated by 

/export/data/share/wufeng/programs/cellkit/struct_mix_linear.py relax_final relax_init -n -r "0.0 0.05 0.10 0.15 0.20 0.25 0.5 0.75 0.80 0.85 0.90 0.95 1.00"
With the presence of "template.in" and/or "occ.in" (only used for occupation CDFT calculation). The atom positions will be generated and append to "template.in" to create a new "scf.in" file in ratio-* folders

Two finished relax calculation : relax_final.in, relax_final.out  (and relax_init.in relax_init.out) must be present to make the above command work. Note relax_final and relax_init can be replaced by any valid string, given *.in and *.out present.


Input file specification
========================



Data options
--------------


ratio_final: 0.0, default setting
ratio_init: 1.0, default setting


Wif part
--------
bulkband_index: [N1,N2]
defectband_index: N3  
defectband_spin: "up" or "down"  

The Wif between band (start from 1) N3 and N1, N1+1, N1+2, ... N2 of the specific spin channel will be computed, and the largest will be picked as Wif used


Others
-------

dE:  energy difference between minimum of initial and final potential energy surfaces
dimension: "xy" or "xyz", to compute the coefficient in 2D or 3D cases
temperature: an array of selected temperature (unit Kelvin) to compute the [10,50,100,300,600] 
g: the degeneracy factor in case there are multiple sites in the supercell
